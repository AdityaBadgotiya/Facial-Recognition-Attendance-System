# Face Recognition Attendance System - Project Description

This is a Python-based **Face Recognition Attendance System** that provides automated attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. The system features:

## Key Features:
- **Dual login system** (Admin & Student roles)
- **Facial registration** - Capture and train student face images
- **Real-time attendance marking** using face detection
- **Comprehensive dashboard** showing attendance records
- **Email reporting** functionality to send attendance reports
- **Student management** (add/delete students and their facial data)
- **Password security** with SHA-256 hashing

## Technical Components:
- Built with **Tkinter** for GUI
- Uses **OpenCV** for face detection and recognition
- **Pillow** for image processing
- **CSV files** for data storage
- **SMTP** for email functionality
- **Haar Cascade** classifier for face detection

The system helps educational institutions automate attendance tracking while preventing proxy attendance through facial verification. It provides both admin controls for management and student views for checking personal attendance records.
